# MNP

The `MNP` class is used for generating, simulating, storing, and managing an MNP assembly.
This is the bulk of MAGNA-U.

```python
magna.utils.MNP(id,
                 r_tuple=(4e-9, 3.5e-9, 3e-9),
                 discretizations=(4, 4, 4),
                 ms_tuple=(2.4e5, 3.9e5),
                 a_tuple=(5e-12, 9e-12),
                 k_tuple=(2e4, 5.4e4),
                 name=time.strftime('%b_%d', time.localtime()),
                 form='fcc',
                 shape='hexagon',
                 n_layers=1,
                 layer_radius=3,
                 layer_dims=(3, 10),
                 axes=None,
                 axes_type='random_hexagonal',
                 directory=os.path.join(os.getcwd(), 'MNP_Data'),
                 mesh_csv=None,
                 loaded_fields='')
```
                 

## Attributes
#### Initial Attributes
The following attributes are given to an MNP when it is first initialized: 

- `id`: This is a required positional argument which uses a whole number to designate the
  MNP assembly. If you pass `-1` for the id, the id will be automatically generated
  based on how many existing mnp_* folders are in the directory `{directory}/{name}`, starting
  with 0 if there are none.
- `name`: This can be any string you want. The name can be used to describe the
   usage of the MNP, for example `'varying_a'`, but by default it will just be the
   date that the mnp is created.
    - *default value:* `time.strftime('%b_%d', time.localtime())` (The current date in
     the format like 'Apr-14')
 - `directory`: A string with the directory in which data relating to the MNP
   assembly will be stored. If you pass the name of a directory that does not
   already exist, the program will create it for you.
    - *default value:* `'./MNP_Data'`
 - `r_tuple`: This function takes a tuple of three values in the form
   `(r_total, r_shell, r_core)`where r_total is the total radius between
   individual MNPs, r_shell is the radius of the shell, and r_core is the radius
   of the core, all in meters.
     - *default value:* `(4e-9, 3.5e-9, 3e-9)`
 -  `discretizations`: this takes a tuple of three values in the form (x, y, z), 
    where x, y, and z are the number of divisions per r_total that determines how
    small each cell is in your simulation for each respective axis. A larger number
    makes more divisions and smaller cells. For example, putting 7 for x would
    result in a total x discretization length of r_total/7.
     - *default value:* `(4,4,4)`
 - `ms_tuple`: This function takes a tuple of two values in the form
   `(ms_shell, ms_core)`where ms_shell is the saturation magnetization of the
   shell, and ms_core is the saturation magnetization of the core, all in A/m.
     - *default value:* `(2.4e5, 3.9e5)`
 - `a_tuple`: This function takes a tuple of two values in the form
   `(a_shell, a_core)`where a_shell is the exchange stiffness constant of the
   shell, and a_core is the exchange stiffness constant of the core, all in J/m.
     - *default value:* `(5e-12, 9e-12)` 
 - `k_tuple`: This function takes a tuple of two values in the form
   `(k_shell, k_core)`where k_shell is the magnetic anisotropy constant of the
   shell, and k_core is the magnetic anisotropy constant of the core, all in J/m<sup>3</sup>.
     - *default value:* `(2e4, 5.4e4)`
 - `shape`: the shape of one layer of MNPs. Current options are `'hexagon'`, `'circle'`, and `'rectangle'`.
     - *default value:* `'hexagon'`
 - `form`: the method of packing/stacking. Current options are `'fcc'` (face-centered cubic),
   `'hcp'` (hexagonal close-packing), `'scp'` (simple close-packing), and `'bcc'` (body-centered cubic).
     - *default value:* `'fcc'`
 - `layer_radius`: Specify this for circle or hexagon shapes.For circles, this is the radius of the 
   circle in # of spheres. For hexagons, this is the circumradius/side length of the hexagon in # of spheres.
     - *default value:* `3`
- `layer_dims`: Specify this for rectangular shapes. This is a tuple (x, y) with the dimensions of a
  layer in # of spheres. Note that because the y spacing is smaller than the x spacing, a `layer_dims`
  of `(3, 3)` will not be a square. Rather, y should be multiplied by 2*sqrt(3), so the closest
  dimensions for a square would be `layer_dims = (3, 10)`
    - *default value:* `(3, 10)`
- `n_layers`: The number of lattice layers stacked on top of each other.
    - *default value:* `1`
- `axes`: can take a list of 3vectors corresponding to the uniaxial anisotropy easy axis for
  each nanoparticle in the assembly. Use this if you want to predetermine what the easy axes are,
  otherwise leave this blank and the axes will be automatically randomly generated.
    - *default value:* `None`
-  `axes_type`: This is how the easy axes will be randomly generated: `'all_random'` for easy axes
   as any 3vector, `'random_plane'` for easy axes in the xy plane, or
   `'random_hexagonal'` for easy axes in the xy plane in one of six hexagonal directions 120Â° apart.
    - *default value:* `'random_hexagonal'`
- `mesh_csv`: a string containing the location of a [pre-generated csv file](csv_pregen.md) with each point in the mesh 
  and whether it is in a core/shell or not. If a file is given, it will be used to generate MAKU fields 
  much faster than from scratch. If `None` is given, MAKU fields are generated in the standard, time-consuming way.
    - *default value:* `None`
- `loaded_fields`: A string containing any of m, a, k, and u corresponding to the "maku" fields to
  be preloaded from a file. Used by the `load_mnp` function but can be ignored otherwise.
    - *default value:* `''`
    
#### More Helpful Attributes
The following attributes are generated automatically after an MNP has been instantiated: 

 - `coord_list`: a list of the coordinates of all of the centers of a sphere, generated
   automatically when a new MNP is instantiated. The spacing between each center is one unit.
 - `scaled_coords`: a list of coordinates of all of the centers of spheres, scaled by `r_total`
   to be phyisically representative of the MNP scale.
 - `summary`: a string of text containing formatted summary information about an MNP
 - `mesh`: a `discretisedfield.Mesh` object with the correct dimensions and cell size for the MNP assembly

#### Field Attributes
The following attributes are `discretisedfield.Field` objects that do not take their values
until they are initialized using the [`MNP.initialize`](#initializing-fields) method. 

 - `m_field`: the initial magnetization field
 - `a_field`: the exchange constant field
 - `k_field`: the uniaxial anisotropy constant field
 - `u_field`: the uniaxial anisotropy easy axis field

## Methods
#### Initializing Fields
The "maku" fields of an MNP will not be generated until you run the `initialize` method.
`magna.utils.MNP.initialize(fields='maku', autosave=True, m0='random')` 

The fields you want to be initialized are input as the argument `fields`, which takes a 
string containing any of `'m'`, `'a'`, `'k'`, and `'u'`. 

If `autosave=True`, then the fields
that you generate will automatically be saved to the MNP directory and can be loaded in the
future rather than generated afresh. 

In addition, while the initial magnetic field is by default
random, you can set it to a constant vector by passing a 3vector tuple for `m0`, such as `m0=(0,0,1)`.

#### Field Methods      
The following methods are used to perform operations on `discretisedfield.Field` object, such as
saving fields and loading fields: 

 - `maku()`: returns a list `[MNP.m_field, MNP.a_field, MNP.k_field, MNP.u_field]`. You can automatically
   unpack this into the respective fields by doing something like `M, A, K, U = mnp.maku()`
 - `save_fields(filepath='default', fields='maku')`: saves all of the fields specified by the `fields`
   argument, which should contain a string with any of m, a, k, and u. By default, fields are saved to
   the MNP's standard filepath, but this can be changed by specifying a different `filepath`. Fields
   are saved in the `.ovf` format.
 - `save_any_field(field, field_name, filepath='default')`: saves a `df.Field` object to a `.ovf` which
    is specified by the `field` argument. By default, the field is saved to
   the MNP's standard filepath, but this can be changed by specifying a different `filepath`. The file name
   will be `{filepath}/{field_name}_mnp_{MNP.id}.ovf`.
 - `load_fields(fields='maku', filepath='default')`: loads any of the "maku" fields which are specified
    by the `fields` string. Files are loaded from the MNP's standard filepath, but can be loaded from a
   different location by specifying another `filepath`.
 - `load_any_field(field_name, filepath='default')`: returns a `df.Field` object by loading the
    field found in the file `{field_name}_mnp_{MNP.id}.ovf` in the `filepath` directory (the default
   directory is the MNP standard filepath).
 - `save_all()`: saves both the MNP summary data and the "maku" fields at the same time  

#### Hidden Methods
These methods are not generally meant to be accessed by the user, but rather are used by other
methods behind the scenes.

 - `make_easy_axes(self)`: generates a list of random easy axes
 - `if_circle(self, point, r)`: for a given 3D point determines whether that point is
   within a radius `r` of any sphere center in `coord_list`
 - `ms_func(self, point)`: used to determine the saturation magnetization value of a
   point based on whether it is in the outside, shell, or core of an MNP
 - `a_func(self, point)`: used to determine the exchange stiffness constant of a
   point based on whether it is in the outside, shell, or core of an MNP
 - `k_func(self, point)`: used to determine the magnetic anisotropy constant of a
   point based on whether it is in the outside, shell, or core of an MNP
 - `circle_index(self, point, n_list)`: returns the index of a sphere center in `n_list`
   which is closest to the point.
 - `u_func(self, point)`: used to determine the uniaxial anisotropy easy axis of a
   point based on whether it is in the outside, shell, or core of an MNP
 - `make_m_field(self, m0='random')`: makes the `MNP.m_field` the appropriate `df.Field` object. 
   By default, m0 is random, but a 3vector tuple can be passed instead.
 - `make_a_field(self)`: makes the `MNP.a_field` the appropriate `df.Field` object.
 - `make_k_field(self)`: makes the `MNP.k_field` the appropriate `df.Field` object.
 - `make_u_field(self)`: makes the `MNP.u_field` the appropriate `df.Field` object.
